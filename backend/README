Welcome to the backend for AltStack.

/gameLobby.pl
	This is the main perl module that runs both the lobbies and the games.
	The games simply fork off of this. Most of the server aspects are handled
	here, along with logic to communicate between lobbies and games.

/cgi-bin/altStackStart.cgi
	A simple perl script that starts gameLobby.pl remotely.

/cgi-bin/altStackAPI.c
	Compile this C file as a .cgi and place it in a cgi-bin folder. This file
	accepts http POST requests from clients and forwards them onto the gameLobby.pl
	and any games that it forks off. This is done through socket files that are located
	in /gameFiles/

/gameFiles/die
	All of the lobbies and games look for this file. If it is there they will all die
	gracefully. This is useful for eliminating zombie processes.

/gameFiles/userInfo
	A dud database that is used right now to store user information and passwords.
	This is just stored in JSON format with passwords in plain text, so do not let
	users use secure information.

/webTest/P*.html
	These are crude test pages for the backend. P1 and P2 are made to be a set pair.
	You can use these to login and test features like messaging and playing the game.
	Note that each client will attempt to open 4+ websockets. This means you will need
	to use a seperate brower if you want to test them on the same machine.
	P3 logs in as the special test1 user. This user does not need an opponent to play
	a game, instead once logged in, the game drops preset singles that test most of the
	games physics and internal logic.

/modules/Game.pm
	This is the beast. I did not have time to seperate this, so this file just grew out of
	control. This takes care of running the actual game. A flow chart of the internals can
	be found in the project's documents.

/modules/Command/*
	This directory's files each correspond to 1 or 2 data packets that can be passed around
	from client to the lobby and game and between the game and lobby. Each packet contains a
	name in it, and that name correspondes to a function that will be called in one of these
	files. The mapping of commands to files and file names can be found in the main game
	structure of gameLobby.pl
